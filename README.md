Calories Burnt Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to accurately predict calories burnt during physical activities. Fitness monitoring is essential for health tracking, and estimating calorie expenditure helps individuals maintain or achieve fitness goals. Traditional methods like wearables and BMR-based formulas often lack accuracy and personalization. This project uses data-driven machine learning models on a calories dataset to improve prediction performance.

Dataset
The dataset used is calories.csv, containing features such as gender, age, height, weight, duration of activity, heart rate, and body temperature, with calories burnt as the target variable.

Models Implemented
Linear Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (KNN)

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor
